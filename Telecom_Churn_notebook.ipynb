    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the competitive Telecom industry, customer retention is a critical challenge. A churn rate ranging from 10 to 60 percent significantly impacts a company's growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Churn in Telecom\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Churn**: Represents the percentage of customers discontinuing a service within a specific period.\n",
    "- **Churn Category and Reason**:\n",
    "  - *Churn Category*: Broad classification of why customers leave.\n",
    "  - *Churn Reason*: Specific rationale behind a customer's decision to churn.\n",
    "- **Multiclass Classification**: Used to predict both churn category and reason.\n",

    "\n",
    "The aim is to utilize multiclass and multilevel classification for:\n",

    "- **Predicting Churn**: Determining the category and specific reasons for customer churn.\n",
    "- **Strategy Development**: Assisting telecom companies in creating targeted retention strategies to reduce churn, boost customer retention, and increase satisfaction.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. We will try to understand the churn data first and do a detailed problem specific EDA;\n",
    "2. We'll build a model to predict the churn category using multi-class classification;\n",

In other words, given a set of input data, the task is to predict the class label of the instance, where the instance can belong to any one of the several predefined classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a medical diagnosis application, the goal may be to predict whether a patient has a certain disease, where the disease can be one of several possibilities. In this case, the output of the classification model would be a probability distribution over the possible classes, with the highest probability indicating the predicted class.\n",

    "There are various algorithms that can be used for multiclass classification, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.

    "**Decision Trees in Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification as well as regression problems. They are widely used in machine learning because they are easy to understand and interpret, and can handle both categorical and numerical data. The idea behind decision trees is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Splitting Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a decision tree, we need a measure that determines how to split the data at each node. The splitting criterion is chosen based on the type of data and the nature of the problem. The most common splitting criteria are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gini index: measures the impurity of a set of labels. It calculates the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen element from the set, and is used to minimize misclassification errors.\n",
    "* Information gain: measures the reduction in entropy (uncertainty) after a split. It is used to maximize the information gain in each split.\n",
    "* Chi-square: measures the difference between observed and expected frequencies of the classes. It is used to minimize the deviation between the observed and expected class distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods are techniques that combine multiple models to improve performance and reduce overfitting, a typical issue with decision trees. The two most common ensemble methods used with decision trees are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bagging \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Random Forest as a bagging technique to introduce bootstrap sampling is a statistical technique that involves randomly sampling the data with replacement to create multiple subsets. These subsets are used to train individual decision trees. By using bootstrap samples, the algorithm can generate multiple versions of the same dataset with slightly different distributions. This introduces randomness into the training process, which helps to reduce overfitting over Bagging techniques for algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using XGBoost as a the key idea behind XGBoost is that it improves upon the predictions of the weak learners by focusing on the misclassified data points. By fitting a new tree to the residuals, XGBoost can correct the errors of the previous model and improve its overall accuracy. Additionally, XGBoost uses regularization to prevent overfitting and to improve generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deecision trees are powerful tools for classification problems that provide a clear and interpretable representation of the decision rules learned from the data. The choice of splitting criterion, stopping criterion, and ensemble method can have a significant impact on the performance and generalization of the model."

    "\n",
    "The primary idea behind this technique is to develop models in a sequential manner, with each model attempting to reduce the mistakes of the previous model.The additive model, loss function, and a weak learner are the three fundamental components of Gradient Boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method provides a direct interpretation of boosting in terms of numerical optimization of the loss function using Gradient Descent. We employ Gradient Boosting Regressor when the target column is continuous, and Gradient Boosting Classifier when the task is a classification problem. The \"Loss function\" is the only difference between the two. The goal is to use gradient descent to reduce this loss function by adding weak learners. Because it is based on loss functions, for regression problems, Mean squared error (MSE) will be used, and  for classification problems, log-likelihood."

    "\n",
    "#### The following evaluation metrics have been identified as important for addressing the business problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "**F1 score:** Use the F1 score when the class distribution is imbalanced, and when both precision and recall are equally important.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall score:** The recall score will be used as the cost of false negatives (missing customers likely to churn) is high. For example, in this project missing out on customers that are likely to churn is more important than misclassifying customers that arne't at risk of churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confusion matrix:**  The confusion matrix is a versatile tool that can be used to visualize the performance of a model across different classes. It can be useful for identifying specific areas of the model that need improvement. As this project will be used in an iterative manner, it will be important to optimize the model by analyzing previous models' failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ROC AUC score:** the ROC AUC score will be used as it's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes is important. Ideally we would like to have the clearest picture possible in terms of a customer's likelihood of churn so as to not needlessly waste resources on customers that don't churn and properly identify customers with a good risk of churn."
